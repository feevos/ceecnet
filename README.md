# ** UPDATE **
We added a pure semantic segmentation model that uses CEECNetV1, CEECNetV2 or FracTAL ResNet micro-topologies, based on a single encoder/decoder macro-topology (unet-like). These can be found in location: ```models/semanticsegmentation/x_unet```.

Official [mxnet](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/) implementation of the paper: ["Looking for change? Roll the Dice and demand Attention"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02062), Diakogiannis et al. (2020). This repository contains source code for implementing and training the mantis ceecnet/FracTAL ResNet as described in our manuscript. All models are built with the mxnet DL framework (version < 2.0), under the gluon api. We do not provide pre-trained weights. 

Inference examples for the task of Building change detection for the model mantis ceecnetV1 (fractal Tanimoto loss tdepth, ftdepth=5). From left to right, input image date 1, input image date 2, ground truth, inference, confidence heat map for the segmentation task.

In directory ```chopchop``` exists code for splitting triplets of raster files (date1, date2, ground truth) into small training patches. It is tailored on the LEVIR CD dataset. In  ```demo``` exists a notebooks that shows how to initiate a mantis ceecnet model, and perform forward and multitasking backward operations. In ```models/changedetection/mantis``` exists a generic definition for arbitrary depth and number of filters, that are described in our manuscript. In ```nn``` exist all the necessary building blocks to construct the models we present, as well as loss function definitions. In particular, in ```nn/loss``` we provide the average fractal Tanimoto with dual (file ```nn/loss/ftnmt_loss.py```), as well as a class that can be used for multitasking loss training. Users of this method may want to write their own custom implementation for multitasking training, based on the ```ftnmt_loss.py``` file. See ```demo``` for example usage with a specific ground truth labels configuration. In ```src``` we provide a mxnet Dataset class, as well as a normalization class. Finally, in utils, there exist a function for selecting BatchNormalization, or GroupNorm, as a paremeter.
